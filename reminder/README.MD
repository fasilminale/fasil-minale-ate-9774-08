Reminder

a simple python script to remind to-do-tasks using mvc arctecture



Features

Usage

$python3 reminder.py


why i use mvc?

to separate data(model) and user interface(view) concerns, so that changes to the user interface
will not affect data handling, and that the data handling and that the data can be recognized
without changing the ui.

for this project mvc makes easy to maintain and read the code.
